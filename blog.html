        <strong>"Nelangsa: Sadness, Cry!"</strong>
        <br>
        It's been a long time since you've been sad in the memories and memories of the past.
        <br>
        It's okay if you want to look back on it, remembering every winding, narrow and complicated path you've been through.
        <br>
        "They Said" it all is a lesson, a lesson that also never met with understanding.
        <br>
        Sometimes humans need sadness to know what happiness is.
        <br>
        Sometimes humans also need pain to simply know the meaning of rest.
        <br>
        <strong> be sad, cry out loud, then take a rest. </strong>
        <br>
        Mother said, "it's okay, kid, it's okay, in the end, all that's left is you alone.
        <br>
        All humans must be given the opportunity to rest one day, untie of all ties in the world.
        <br>
        Leaving a trail of light, which will then be tread back on the next life.
        <br>
        With or without the same person.
        <br>
