        <strong>nelangsa / ne · lang · sa /: sad</strong>
        <br>
        is an emotion that is characterized by feelings of lack, loss, and helplessness.
        <br>
        The inspiration to use the word 
        miserable as the name of our project is because basically normal people generally only show their happy side to the 
        outside world even though they are sad. Nelongso illustrates that sadness is a human thing, in this day and age many 
        people are bullied because of crying or sadness. We want to show that sadness is natural and is needed by everyone. 
        We also want to say that it's okay if you're sad and that there really is a time when you have to deal with sadness.
